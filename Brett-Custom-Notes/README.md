# Brett's QwenCode Custom Notes & Enhancements

## Files in This Directory

- `slash-command-automation.md` - High-impact slash commands to build
- `qwencode-capabilities.md` - Advanced features already built into QwenCode  
- `parallel-execution-patterns.md` - Proven patterns for concurrent tool execution

## Key Discoveries

1. **QwenCode already has world-class file editing** - multi-stage correction, range reading, smart discovery
2. **Parallel tool execution** - new capability for 3-5x workflow speed improvement  
3. **Slash command system** - can automate common patterns and reduce LLM decision overhead

## Next Priorities

- Session checkpointing for context preservation
- Custom slash commands for frequent workflows
- Agent launching automation
