## üéØ Enhanced Features & Tools

This fork extends the standard Qwen Code with professional development tools and intelligent workflow automation:

### üêç **Python Development Suite**
Modern Python development requires consistent code quality and formatting. These tools eliminate the friction of maintaining professional Python codebases by automating quality checks and formatting decisions.

- **Flake8 Integration**: Catches style violations and potential bugs early in development, preventing code review delays and maintaining team coding standards
- **Black Formatter**: Removes formatting debates entirely by applying consistent, opinionated formatting that every Python developer recognizes
- **Intelligent Linting**: Automatically runs quality checks after edits, catching issues before they reach version control

### üèóÔ∏è **Project Intelligence Tools**  
Understanding large codebases quickly is essential for effective development. This analyzer provides multiple perspectives on project structure to help developers navigate and comprehend complex systems.

- **Project Structure Analyzer**: Provides instant architectural understanding of unfamiliar codebases through multiple analysis modes:
  - `tree`: Navigate directory hierarchies visually
  - `overview`: Get high-level project understanding in seconds  
  - `architecture`: Identify design patterns and architectural decisions
  - `metrics`: Assess code health and complexity
  - `dependencies`: Understand project relationships and potential refactoring opportunities

### üß† **RAG-Enhanced Code Analysis**
Traditional search finds text matches; semantic search understands intent and relationships. This enables developers to ask conceptual questions about code and get meaningful answers.

- **Deep Semantic Search**: Find code by describing what it does, not just what it's called - essential for working with unfamiliar codebases
- **Cross-Reference Analysis**: Discover how different parts of the system interact without manually tracing through imports
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Get recommendations based on the entire project context, not just the current file

### üéµ **Voice Feedback System**
Long-running operations leave developers wondering about progress. Audio feedback enables multitasking and provides reassurance during complex automated tasks.

- **TTS Integration**: Stay informed about progress without constantly watching the screen - work on other tasks while operations complete
- **Multi-Voice Support**: Assign different voices to different types of work for instant context recognition
- **Bluetooth Audio**: Use wireless speakers for clear audio feedback without being tethered to the workstation

### üìã **Enhanced Task Management**
Complex development work involves many interdependent steps. Proper task tracking prevents forgotten requirements and provides visibility into progress.

- **Persistent Task Lists**: Never lose track of what needs to be done across long development sessions
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Instantly see what's complete, in-progress, or pending without scanning text
- **Intelligent Task Breakdown**: Automatically decompose complex features into actionable steps

### üîç **Advanced Search & Navigation**
Modern development requires information from multiple sources. Integrated research tools eliminate context switching between the development environment and external resources.

- **Web Research Tools**: Gather documentation and examples without leaving the development workflow
- **Memory System**: Maintain project-specific knowledge across sessions, reducing ramp-up time
- **Enhanced File Operations**: Intelligent pattern recognition for bulk operations and project maintenance

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience Enhancements**
Development efficiency comes from removing friction and automating routine tasks. These enhancements bring IDE-quality features to the command line environment.

- **IDE-Level Capabilities**: Access sophisticated analysis tools without switching to heavy IDE environments
- **Workflow Automation**: Reduce repetitive tasks that interrupt creative problem-solving
- **Error Prevention**: Catch common mistakes before they become bugs or deployment issues

## üñ•Ô∏è **Local Model Recommendations**

Running Qwen Code locally provides complete privacy and control over your development workflow. Based on extensive testing, these model configurations deliver excellent performance:

### ‚ö° **High-Speed Development** - `qwen/qwen3-4b-2507`
- **Performance**: 120+ tokens/second on dual RTX 3090 setup
- **Context Window**: 190k tokens with KV quantization + Flash Attention enabled
- **Best for**: Code completion, simple refactoring, documentation, basic analysis
- **Experience**: Comparable to Gemini Flash in Gemini CLI - fast, responsive, and highly effective for routine development tasks
- **Why it works**: The enhanced system prompts and instructions make this lightweight model punch well above its weight class

### üß† **Complex Problem Solving** - `qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-2507`  
- **Performance**: Slower but significantly more capable reasoning
- **Context Window**: 131k tokens with KV quantization + Flash Attention enabled
- **Best for**: Architecture decisions, complex refactoring, debugging challenging issues, system design
- **When to use**: Multi-step problems requiring deep analysis and planning
- **Note**: While thinking modes can help, the raw capability often delivers results faster than waiting for step-by-Step reasoning

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Notes**
- **KV Quantization**: Enables massive context windows but may cause tool repetition loops - disable if you encounter this issue
- **Without KV Quant**: Context window reduces to ~96k tokens but eliminates repetition issues and reduces VRAM consumption
- **Flash Attention**: Essential for handling large context windows efficiently

### üí° **Usage Strategy**
Start with the 4B model for immediate feedback and rapid iteration. Switch to the 30B model when you encounter problems that require deeper reasoning or when the 4B model's suggestions need more sophistication. The speed difference makes this workflow practical - use fast local inference for the majority of tasks, reserving the larger model for complex challenges.

This local setup eliminates API costs and latency while maintaining professional-grade AI assistance throughout your development workflow.
